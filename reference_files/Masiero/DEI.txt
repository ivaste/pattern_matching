Characteristics and objectives The master degree in Computer Engineering forms a professional, second-level engineer, benefiting from the cutting-edge research activities expressed by the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padua. The professional profile of the graduate student is therefore of high profile and able to use a wide range of knowledge to interpret, describe and solve in an innovative way problems of computer engineering, which require a strong in-depth analysis together with an interdisciplinary approach. The specific training in Computer Engineering concerns all the foundamental theoretical and applicative topics, such as computational theory, algorithmics, operating systems and distributed systems, modern computing system architectures, computer networks, databases. Furthermore, the most recent advances in artificial intelligence and robotics, in big data processing, in the web sciences are presented. The flexibility allowed by the various proposed study paths allows the choice between courses also on other specialized topics of considerable applicative impact, within a varied offer that enhances all the specific areas of competence of the teachers of the Department (bioinformatics, computer music, compilers etc.). Training activities that concern the corporate organization and modern telecommunications are also planned. The course of study concludes with the development of a master thesis (with mentor) on activities related either to departmental research or to company internships.

Occupational opportunities The pervasive dissemination of information processing tools in every sector of activity makes the set of employment areas of the master computer engineer extremely broad. Among these are of particular relevance: the automation of services in public and private institutions; distributed systems and applications, especially multimedia ones; embedded processing systems, systems for the analysis of large amounts of data and machine learning systems, applications related to robotics and industry 4.0 and those related to life sciences. In general, these areas are characterized by the need to deal with complex information systems in multidisciplinary contexts.

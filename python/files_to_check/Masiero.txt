INTERNET OF THINGS AND SMART CITIES

Luca Masiero

Introduction
The Internet of Things (commonly known as IoT) is constantly developing in a rapid way and
gaining momentum from both academic research and Industry 4.0, undisputed protagonist of the
Fourth Industrial Revolution.
The advent of IoT increased deployment of resource constrained wireless devices in a market
growing in size day by day. Always connected sensors and actuators advance business models
concerning new products, process innovations and data.
The main concept to be kept in mind when talking about Internet of Things is that standard
Internet protocols are used to interconnect a local network made of smart things (also called
objects), distributed all around the world, for data and information harvesting with functions
such as identification, location, positioning, monitoring and many others.
Thanks to the development of new and well-performing technologies (e.g., RFID1 or embedded
sensors and actuators) IoT has, nowadays, a wide spectrum of real-life applications, ranging from
transportation and logistics to healthcare, from gaming to smart environments, from robotics to
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
Smart things can connect to each other exchanging information and making decisions for their
own users. This will give rise to a new connectivity dimension called connectivity for anything:
ITU endorses, in fact, the definition of IoT as a network that is ”available anywhere, anytime, by
anything and anyone”.
In this report, the origins of 6 LoWPAN are presented in Section 1. In Section 2 a special
attention will be given to both Functions and Structure of 6 LoWPAN, while in Section
3 Security requirements will be analyzed. Section 4 considers the Address management
policy and Section 5 concludes this work by presenting the Routing problem, along with personal
thoughts on possible and promising ideas.

6 LoWPAN: A brief history

6 LoWPAN is the name, born in the first months of 2005, of a Working Group within the IETF2 ,
whose purpose was to define specifications for the transmission of IPv6 packets over IEEE 802.15.4
networks.
The first draft was published on July 11, 2005 and saw the participation of remarkable companies
such as Microsoft and Intel. After thirteen revisions, the official RFC3 was published and became

official in September 2007, but only at the end of the third quarter of 2008 6 LoWPAN would be
recognized as an Internet Standard.
During 2007, important milestones have been achieved and are necessary to understand the
standard’s development. In March Arch Rock, a private Californian company, put on sale the
first commercial implementation based on the IETF4 6 LoWPAN draft. In May, the University of
Bremen conducted a study leading to the first open source implementation. In June, Sensinode,
a Finnish company, released, under General Public License, an implementation of this standard
based on its own hardware platforms. The company expected to market a 6 LoWPAN compatible
router within the first quarter of 2008. At the last IETF meeting in December, Arch Rock and
Hitachi conducted an interoperability test that demonstrated that 6 LoWPAN devices can work
together over IPv6 systems.

As stated in the Introduction, the key components for enabling widespread sensing of the
physical world in IoT systems are sensors and things that are connected to low-power wireless
networks in locations that are, from the geographic point of view, dispersed and characterized from
little or completely inexistent networking infrastructures.
This kind of networks and devices can be characterized by a number of constraints that force
crucial design compromises and restrictions at the implementation level and enabling them to
participate, in an active way, in the Internet-style Internetworking would represent advantages and
efficiencies in the overall IoT system design.

The IETF can be defined as ”a loosely self-organized group of people who make technical or other contributions
to the engineering and evolution of the Internet and its technologies.” It is an organization based on the spontaneous
contribution of various Working Groups, formed by a small number of individuals interested in a specific and limited
topic, with a precise task to complete. The activities to be performed take mainly place in two distinct moments:
the mailing lists and international meetings.
There is no membership in the strict sense of the word in the IETF, so it is sufficient to register and participate
voluntarily to the activities.
This premise is important in order to understand the nature of 6 LoWPAN, which is an open standard. It is a
standard not only because it is free to use, but also because the specifications, concerning circumscribed subjects, are
made available to the public during their definition through documents, better known as Internet Drafts. Internet
Drafts are embryonic specifications that are valid only for six months, after which they may be removed, modified,
or approved as RFCs (the next level of the standard’s approval process).

The 6 LoWPAN5 is a standardized protocol adaptation layer that accomplishes this task and
defines the use of IP networking over IEEE 802.15.4 low-power wireless networks, bringing the IP
capability to devices at the edge: in this way they can be both sources and destinations reachable
from the Internet, making global connectivity possible.
To be undelined is the fact that the use of IP provides a remarkable number of benefits (e.g.,
interoperability, naming and address translation, established transport and application protocols,
security, scalability, reliability and manageability); IPv6 provides ample addressing capability to
accommodate projected growth of IoT endpoints well into the future: IPv4, in fact, has an address
field made of 32 bits long, setting, in this way, an upper limit of 232 distinct addresses6 . This
number is, unfortunately, insufficient for the billions of IP addressable IoT things on the horizon
and IPv6, for this reaason, has a 128-bit address field and the capability of 1036 unique addresses.
6 LoWPAN represents the network-layer building block that brings Internet compatibility via
adaptation to constrained networks and nodes. On top of the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC, it
works well with CoAP7 and completes the protocol stack suitable for use with constrained IoT
devices and networks8 .

6 LoWPAN: Security requirements

The RFC4919 specifies a list of security requirements for 6 LoWPAN (mainly aimed at protecting
the communications from the users to the sensor network). The most important requirements are
the following:
5

6 LoWPAN stands for IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks.
The exact number of addresses is 4,294,967,296.
7
CoAP stands for Constrained Application Protocol and it enables nodes to communicate with the Internet using
similar protocols. CoAP is designed for use between devices on the same constrained network (e.g., Low-Power or
Lossy Networks), between devices and general nodes on the Internet, and between devices on different constrained
networks both joined by an internet.
8
6 LoWPAN also provides a definition for encapsulating TCP and UDP packets into payload of IEEE 802.15.4
MAC frames.

6 LoWPAN: Address management policy

IEEE 802.15.4 defines two types of addresses: IEEE EUI-64 bit extended addresses, globally unique,
or 16 bit short addresses, unique only within the PAN. Both types are supported by 6 LoWPAN.
To use short addresses at the network level, since they are only available after they have been
assignment by the PAN coordinator and their validity is limited to the validity of the association,
6 LoWPAN requires that their use be made under certain conditions and within certain limits.
In 6 LoWPAN it is assumed that a PAN is mapped within a specific IPv6 link: this implies the
use of a common prefix for the devices in the network.
This assumption has important consequences in address management for three different aspects:
1. management of multicast communication;
2. network self-configuration;
3. creation and manipulation of local link addresses.
After having established the criteria for constructing and managing IPv6 addresses on IEEE
802.15.4 networks, it is necessary to illustrate how the transmission of IPv6 packets is feasible.
6 LoWPAN describes two basic mechanisms: an adaptive layer for inserting only the necessary
information, and a header compression scheme. These techniques are aimed at reducing the
information to be sent over the radio as much as possible in order to minimize the overall network
overhead.

4.1

Adaptive layer

In order to be able to transfer the information from the upper layers to the lower ones, an adaptive
layer will incrementally build the packet according to the IP philosophy (inserting additional
information only when required). For this purpose, the 6 LoWPAN packet has an optional initial
part, consisting of a stack of headers describing the type of packet being transmitted. The stack
includes:
1. a support header for communications over mesh networks;
2. a header for broadcast communications;
3. a header for handling packet fragmentation.
All headers are optional; any of the three headers, or none at all, may appear in a 6 LoWPAN
packet. The optionality does not imply processing or interpretation discretion: there is, in fact,
a packet construction scheme that the headers must follow. The sequence of headers is shown in
Figure 4.

5

INTERNET OF THINGS AND SMART CITIES

Luca Masiero

Figure 4 . 6 LoWPAN optional headers.

6 LoWPAN inherits from IPv6 a mechanism for resolving the ambiguity that arises from the
the possible presence of multiple optional headers: the use of the dispatch, an additional byte
that always precedes the actual headers and allows their recognition and consequently the correct
interpretation.
The mesh header is present in packets that use a mesh routing protocol to route them and
does not specify which mesh routing protocol to adopt, but is merely a medium for encoding the
information needed for any mesh routing protocol.
An optional header often used in combination with the previous one is reserved for broadcast
communications. The header ends with a byte used for a Sequence Number field that is set by the
source of the transmission and is used to recognize duplicate packets.
A packet fragmentation mechanism is required to encapsulate IPv6 packets, up to 1280 bytes
long, within IEEE 802.15.4 packets whose available payload varies from 81 to 102 bytes.

4.2

Header compression

In the worst case, only 81 bytes are available, for the upper layers, in an IEEE 802.15.4 frame.
Considering that the IPv6 header occupies 40 bytes, only 41 bytes would be left for the data of the
upper layers. If the UDP protocol is also used, we have to consider an additional header of 8 bytes
and therefore only 33 bytes for the application layer. The adaptive layer, described in Subsection
4.1, further reduces the available space, requiring at least one dispatch byte to encapsulate the
uncompressed IPv6 header.
It is crucial that a header compression mechanism is indispensable in order to use IPv6 protocol
in a rational way on IEEE 802.15.4 networks.
The compression mechanism of the IPv6 header is called HC1 9 and is possible when devices are
already part of a 6 LoWPAN network and share the network’s prefix. This allows to implement a
simple and effective compression mechanism that does not require the use of any specific algorithm
but is obtained by simply eliminating shared or redundant information from the packet.
The UDP Header Compression mechanism is beyond the scope of this report.

Routing: An open research field

This last section opens a window on a research topic that is currently debated in the scientific
community.
I will provide, after having studied the scientific articles listed in the References section, a
personal analysis of the most important requirements for an effective 6 LoWPAN routing strategy,
highlighting ideas, that can be applied to the Internet of Things, acquired from other University
courses followed in the two last years of my academic career.

5.1

Routing: General framework

The main criteria, identified by combining the contributions from [2] and [3], that 6 LoWPAN
routing protocols have to satisfy are the following:
• support of different types of communication (unicast, anycast or multicast);
• constraint-based and adaptive routing with different network conditions;
• support of different traffic: multipoint-to-point, point-to-multipoint and point-to-point traffic;
• scalability, security and performance.
When looking at security problems of 6 LoWPAN, routing is one of the weakest aspects because
nodes are easy to be compromised while they are frequently moving in the networks, and contact
with new and, most of the times, unauthenticated neighbours could represent possible attack
scenarios.

5.2

Routing: Mesh-Under vs Route-Over

Within the IETF, a major conceptual difficulty has not only been on the routing policy to be
adopted but also on how this should be related to the network’s protocol used in WSNs10 . Two
are the identified ”schools of thought”: the first one argues that routing mechanisms should be
adopted below the network protocol (Mesh-under ), the second states that the routing protocol
should be directly based on the network protocol (Route-over ).

Figure 5 . Mesh-under and Route-over routing.

Even though the distinction is not trivial, these mechanisms guarantee interoperability, allowing
packets routing also between different PANs and Link Layers, such as IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11,
IEEE 802.16 and so on.

Routing: Topology

RPL11 components include WSN nodes, that act as hosts or intermediate routers for transmitting
packets, and a local border router in the network’s edge that communicates through a common
backbone.
6 LoWPAN nodes connect with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology to prevent any
network loop. This DAG is divided into Destination Oriented DAGs (DODAGs), where the roots
of these DODAGs usually are local border routers connected together and to the Internet through
the backbone. The DODAG can be considered as a logical configuration of physical nodes (a node
can join multiple DODAGs to support routing optimization).
Figure 6 shows in detail this general architecture.

Figure 6 . 6 LoWPAN architecture.

Nodes in DODAG select and optimize the path using some node/link metrics and constraints
(known as DODAG instances) such as node state, node energy, hop count, throughput and latency.
The node uses objective functions to point out particular metrics chosen for optimizing routes,
represented by Objective Code Point (OCP). On the basis of objective functions and path cost
towards the root, the rank (or depth) of nodes is calculated to differentiate their relationship (e.g.,
nodes with the same rank can be sibling nodes, while consecutive rank nodes can be parents and
child).

Routing: Main requirements

The main features and requirements needed in order to develop an effective routing strategy, shown
in Figure 8 , are discussed by building a ”bridge” between different fields, letting the reader
understand that there exists a link between apparently unrelated subjects:

Figure 7 . Taxonomy of routing requirement in 6 LoWPAN.

• the node should support sleep mode (equal to a periodical hibernation) for battery saving.
This concept is taken into account when considering neural networks’ optimization applied
to the Internet of Things: the dropout is a computationally inexpensive but powerful method
of regularizing models.
The basic idea consists in randomly removing input and hidden units (also called neurons
or nodes) during processing of each pattern; in particular a binary ”mask” (made by zeros
and ones) is sampled and defines which unit should be dropped out according to a fixed
probability hyperparameter p that is usually in the range [0.1, 0.6]. In this way the network’s
units will be forced to learn, on the one hand, the most important features by not relying on
the same nodes, and on the other, a feature that is good in many different contexts.
A similar reasoning can be applied to IoT and the sleep mode of nodes. It could be developed
a routing algorithm that takes into account different paths depending on the fact that some
nodes could effectively be ”shut down” and unavailable for the routing strategy at a specific
moment.

• generated overhead on data packets should be low: routing overhead should consequently
be lower in order to conserve energy;
• small MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit): small packet size requested;
• deep power management: high duty cycle in order to optimize energy savings.
The concept of dropout also results in an interesting energy saving technique letting the
network use a limited number of nodes instead of the whole available quantity. The concept
of power management has been taken into account when developing an IoT Keyword Spotting
algorithm for detecting spoken words from a person to a device/program (e.g., Alexa or Google
Assistant)12 .
• heterogeneous capabilities: protocols should be compatible with many physical devices
interacting with each other and the Internet;
• need of reactive protocols in case of failure or low network connectivity. A routing algorithm
is one of the most important factors that directly impact a network’s performance. To be
kept in mind is the fact that conventional routing algorithms such as Hierarchical Routing
(Hi-Low), 6 LoWPAN Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (LOAD) or Dynamic
MANET On-Demand for 6 LoWPAN Routing (DYMO-Low) do not consider the network
data history (e.g., equipment failures or overloaded paths).
For this reason, Reinforcement Learning could be particularly useful providing advantages
using network data: the intelligent agent should, to accomplish the given task, be able to
learn how to behave in a dynamic environment through a huge number of iterations. Just
to provide a simple example, an agent who makes a certain choice can receive a reward or a
punishment whether the choice was good or bad, respectively (directly influencing the inner
agent’s state). Reinforcement Learning techniques applied to the routing problem related
to 6 LoWPAN can improve the steps to the decision making process of a good path choice,
leading to a final better network performance.
• dynamic adapting and multi-topology routing. From Parallel Computing the concept
of graph embedding can be useful.
Let G = (V, E) and H = (W, F ) be two graphs. An embedding, E = (φ, ψ), of G (guest) and
H (host) is an ordered pair of functions where:
– φ : V −→ W ;
– ψ : E −→ set of simple paths of H, such that ψ(a, b) is a path from φ(a) to φ(b); φ is
known as the placement function, while ψ is known as the routing function.
12

A deep analysis of the Keyword Spotting problem related to IoT (with a proposed solution very close to
the state of the art model) was presented for the final grade by Luca Masiero and Stefano Ivancich for the
Human Data Analytics course, held by Professor Michele Rossi during the second semester of the Academic
Year 2019/2020. The written report, the presentation and a demo are available at the following website:

The concept of graph embedding E can be associated to IoT routing strategies when thinking
about the load of a node and dilation and congestion of edges.
Logical topologies can be developed considering the advantage given by, for instance, a
hypercube-stylish way of placing nodes instead of preferring a linear array or a 2-D mesh;
a 3-D mesh topology could be more effective when considering the characteristics of certain
graphs, such as complete graphs (indicated with KN , where N is the total number of nodes)
or ring topologies. A very important theoretical result states that, keeping in mind the
definition provided above of the graph embedding E: if load l(E) = l, dilation d(E) = d and
congestion c(E) = c then, for any choice of the message schedule, the worst-case slowdown of
the embedding-based simulation procedure satisfies the lower bound
S = Ω(l + d + c)
and the routing strategies should be developed considering bandwidth limits (along with the
theoretical result already discussed).
• flexibility, minimality, scalability, confidentiality and authentication are the last, but
not least, most important characteristics to keep in mind when developing a routing strategy
for 6 LoWPAN.
To provide and example, in [6] the authors consider matrix multiplication, a fundamental
building block of many distributed Machine Learning algorithms, as a remarkable computation
example to show that an IoT system can effectively resist to pollution attacks 13 . The developed
algorithms (for both cloud and user) shew that an IoT system could resist to attacks with a
probability close to 100% by applying transformations on the input data by adding a huge
number of rows to the matrices (then shuffled in a smart way) without limiting the overall
performance of the system. Confidentiality and authentication for the users where ensured
for the whole process14 .
